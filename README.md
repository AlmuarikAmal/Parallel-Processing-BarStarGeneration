# Parallel-Processing-BarStarGeneration
This project involves developing a program that generates bar charts from user-provided arrays of values. The program will be developed using sequential programming, OpenMP, and MPI parallelization techniques. Performance comparisons will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each approach.
